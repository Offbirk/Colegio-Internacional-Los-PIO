# Project "Los PIO International School".

This is a simple project that has the challenge of implementing pure CSS generating a responsive design. This project was developed with the following technologies: 

## Tecnologies

- **HTML**: It contains a main page in which calls to the other views are made and loaded in a framework of the main page, allowing to navigate between the different HTML files of the project.

- **CSS**: A CSS Grid and the implementation of media queries were used to create a responsive design, using different CSS files related to each view. Transitions were also used in the forms to create dynamism in the pages.

- **JS**: Effects were applied to the navigation bar and the login form using some JavaScript events.
